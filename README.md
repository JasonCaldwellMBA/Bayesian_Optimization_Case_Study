# Bayesian_Optimization_Case_Study
Visualize a Bayesian parameter optimization in Python for a Light GBM model.

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms with the following advantages:
- Faster training speed and higher efficiency.
- Lower memory usage.
- Better accuracy.
- Support of parallel and GPU learning.
- Capable of handling large-scale data.
